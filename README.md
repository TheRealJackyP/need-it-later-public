# Need It Later
You have one question to answer and that's whether or not it's time to use that potion you've been holding onto, because you never know if you need it now or if you'll need it later. After all, "you can't have your cake and eat it too".

## Controls:
W/A/S/D to move.
Click to shoot.
Z/X/C/V to use your potions. Hold for expanded selection.
Shift will enable you to gather nearby potions.

## About:
Need it Later was made for the Game Off 2022 jam. The Game Off jam is annually hosted by GitHub, and this year's theme was to make a game based off a clich√©. The idea behind Need it Later is that players often hoard items in anticipation they might need them more later, only to never end up using them.

For example: You ever spend a couple of hours trying to catch Mew-Two in Yellow without consuming your only Master-Ball? I did, and almost immediately after catching him, I realized I had no use for it anymore.

## Install instructions
The game can be played in browser. If you're running Windows and want an improved experience, you can download the game. Just unzip the folder and run it as you would any other game.

There are no major differences between versions. The Windows build should be able to utilize more of your computer's power and assets will be less compressed. That's about it.
